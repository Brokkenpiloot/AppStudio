# Ghost

Ghost is a two player word game where players take turns providing a letter, until a word is made or until a word can no longer be made.
Either way, the last person to have provided a letter is the loser.

1. Users can fill in their names.
2. Users can play Ghost by providing letters one by one.
3. The winner (or not-loser) is given cake! (This cake may or may not be a lie.)
4. The loser will be explained why he lost, and will be provided with possible moves he could have made, if there are any.
5. A scoreboard will increment a player's score after each of his or her wins.
6. A dropdown menu will give users the following options: Reset game (without or with name change), change language, and show scoreboard.
7. Users can forfeit a match to respectfully give their opponent a point on the scoreboard.
8. Game progress will be recorded and will auto-loaded after each new start-up.
9. All previously registered names will be stored for easier access.

* App will need to make use of 2 .txt files, one for dutch and one for english, as its dictionary.
* App will need to be able to save name inputs, together with the total score of that name, for later use in the scoreboard and as suggestions in the text field.
* App will need to be able to save its current state automatically, so that it will continue from that state next time it is opened.
